# Crowdfunding Project

Using the ETL process, we created data pipelines that move raw data to a SQL database.
The data is about crowdfunding campaigns, we created tables to be able to generate reports for stakeholders.

To do the extract and transform phases we used Python, Pandas and Jupyter notebooks by creating a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. We then used that dataset to create an ERD and a table schema to load the CSV file in the crowdfunding database.
